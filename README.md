# Nonstop

## Inspiration
With electric vehicles and autopilot systems becoming more advanced and popular, we are certainly heading towards a driverless world. Not only is a lot of time wasted waiting at red lights or stop signs, intersections are the cause for many car accidents due to human error.

## What it does
Automates flow of traffic by analyzing incoming cars into the intersecting area and adjusting their speeds to allow multiple cars from and going to various directions to pass through without fully stopping before the intersection.

## How We built it
Drew out the many scenarios of cars going through an intersection and solved what cases would cause collisions between 2+ vehicles. We decided to slow down vehicles that were going to crash into others until the preceding vehicle had passed the intersection, which then can speed back up. We built the project fully in C++ and used the SFML library for the front-end.

## Challenges We ran into
As a team of two, we were initially overloaded with tasks. However, we were able to neatly sort out and divide the work so we can get the final project as quickly and efficiently as done before submission. Neither of us had experience with GUI in C++, and calculating the perfect arc and angular frequency was quite difficult.

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
While much can still be worked on, we are proud of our project idea and satisfied with how much we were able to complete with such limited time and resources.

## What We learned
We learned many ways to manipulate vectors and other data types in C++ and how to draw and animate using SFML.

## What's next for Nonstop
Improve animation, path following, and collision prediction. In the future, we wish to make it fully functional for other people and businesses to use and integrate with their vehicles, and to be inspired by and form similar ideas to push our world into the future.
